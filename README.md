# midiroute

`midiroute` is a wonderful little package I found on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/midiroute/) that allows you to route one MIDI port to another, and optionally monitor the data.

I did not write this -- all credit goes to user atticave. I would have forked it, but it appears that its GitHub repo has been deleted, and I can't find any other git repo or even the original author anywhere. So, I `pip install`'d the package and copied the source code.

I plan to add some features, such as CC/note filtering, MIDI scaling, etc.
